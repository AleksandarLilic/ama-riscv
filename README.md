# RISC-V core

**Description:**

Verilog hardware implementation of RISC-V (RV32I) ISA

Project is a part of Advanced Microprocessor Architectures MS course

The final goal is to have a running C code on the FPGA implementation of a design with communication over UART with the PC

**Status:**   
In development

**Further development:**  
TBD
